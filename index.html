          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas Reid. I am an aspiring web 
              developer out of Poughkeepsie, NY. My work ethic, focus, attention to detail, 
              and interpersonal skills set me apart as someone who can do more than just know 
              how to talk to the computer.

      <div id="about">
        <h2>About Nicholas</h2>
        <p>Being born in 1996 I feel like I grew up very harmoniously with the web. 
            I wasn't engulfed in it, I was just as comfortable riding my bike to school every day 
            as I was coming home and being able to use old school messaging services like AIM. 
            I have watched the web grow more exponentially than my classmates though, into an endless sea of possibilities 
            that has shifted my perspective about where my education should be centered. Throughout my academic career 
            I have always been very math oriented. I felt like I could just see the variables changing and the problems being 
            solved in front of my eyes, it came very natural to me. I pursued physics because it was a very scientific 
            application of math but that interest never sparked a passion in me. I came across web development a couple of years 
            ago and I dabbled in trying to teach myself HTML and CSS. Shortly after I found JavaScript and I felt that same 
            satisfaction solving those problems that I would get in math class. The difference is that I can use web development as 
            a tool, unlike math, to truly tap into my creativity in a way I have yet to match. This is why I invested in myself and 
            am taking the Bloc program. So that I can have the proper skills to pursue this newfound passion. I look forward to being 
            able to work underneath great programmers that have started this jouney long before me. Mentorship is one of the most useful 
            tools for learning in my opinion and was one of the main reasons I chose the Bloc program.</p>

        <p>Moving into the first stage of my career these are the kind of jobs and services I am available for:</p>
        <ul id="services-list">
            <li>Working at a company in an entry level position with growth capablilities</li>
            <li>Working with small local buisnesses to help them develop a reliable web presense affordablly</li>
            <li>Working with non-profit organizations and charities pro-bono to help bring good causes onto public platforms</li>
